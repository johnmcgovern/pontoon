Scalable log replay with time travel and time compression.

Features:

- Time Travel: Replays data within a relative second of when it was recorded in proper sequence.
- Time Compression: Speeds the replay up by a configurable amount.
- State Tracking: Saves state before script exit so by default a restart continues off at the same line location and catches up.
